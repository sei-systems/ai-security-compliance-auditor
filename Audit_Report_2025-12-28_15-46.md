## Audit Readiness Report: Daily Compliance Check (2025-12-27 to 2025-12-28)

**Date of Report:** 2025-12-28
**Auditor:** Senior SOC2 & NIST 800-53 Auditor

### Executive Summary

This report provides an analysis of security logs from 2025-12-27 to 2025-12-28 to assess compliance readiness against SOC2 and NIST 800-53 controls. The analysis reveals several critical security incidents, active external threat attempts, and persistent operational issues.

The most concerning findings include numerous unauthorized `sudo` attempts on the `/etc/shadow` file by various user accounts, indicating a severe security compromise or a highly aggressive external attack. Additionally, a significant number of failed login attempts from external IP addresses targeting multiple user accounts suggest active brute-force or credential stuffing attacks. Persistent database connection timeouts also highlight a potential availability and performance issue requiring immediate attention.

These findings point to significant vulnerabilities and active threats that require immediate investigation and remediation to maintain a strong security posture and ensure compliance.

### HIGH Risk Findings

| Finding ID | Description of Event | Date/Time of First Occurrence | Relevant Control IDs | Remediation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H-001 | **20 instances of Critical: Unauthorized sudo attempt on /etc/shadow.**<br>Multiple user accounts (admin, webapp, db_user, root, jdoe) repeatedly attempted unauthorized `sudo` access to `/etc/shadow`. This indicates a severe attempt to access or modify sensitive password hashes, likely for privilege escalation or account compromise. | 2025-12-27 09:46:57 | SOC2 CC6.1 (Access Protection)<br>SOC2 CC7.2 (Incident Monitoring)<br>NIST AC-2 (Account Management)<br>NIST AU-6 (Audit Review) | **Immediate Action Required:**<br>1. **Isolate Affected Systems:** Isolate any systems where these attempts occurred. <br>2. **Investigate User Accounts:** Immediately review and audit permissions for `admin`, `webapp`, `db_user`, `root`, and `jdoe`. Change passwords for these accounts, enforce MFA, and review recent activity. <br>3. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the source of these attempts (internal compromise, external attacker) and whether any were successful. <br>4. **Review Sudoers Configuration:** Audit `/etc/sudoers` files and related configurations to ensure least privilege is enforced and no unauthorized rules exist. <br>5. **Implement EDR/MDR:** Deploy or enhance Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) or Managed Detection and Response (MDR) solutions to detect and prevent such unauthorized privilege escalation attempts in real-time. |

### MEDIUM Risk Findings

| Finding ID | Description of Event | Date/Time of First Occurrence | Relevant Control IDs | Remediation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M-001 | **14 instances of Persistent Database Connection Timeouts from `database_cluster_01`.**<br>Frequent connection timeout errors from the database cluster, spanning the entire log period, suggest a persistent underlying issue with database availability, network connectivity, or resource utilization. | 2025-12-27 09:35:29 | SOC2 CC7.2 (Incident Monitoring)<br>NIST AU-6 (Audit Review) | 1. **Investigate Root Cause:** Immediately investigate the cause of persistent connection timeouts (e.g., network latency/drops, database server load, resource exhaustion, misconfiguration, application-side connection pooling issues).<br>2. **Monitor Database Health:** Enhance monitoring for `database_cluster_01` to track key metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O, active connections, query performance).<br>3. **Review Database Logs:** Analyze database logs for errors, warnings, or performance bottlenecks.<br>4. **Assess Impact:** Determine if these timeouts are impacting critical services or data integrity. |
| M-002 | **Repeated Failed Login Attempts from External IP 185.220.101.5.**<br>9 failed login attempts targeting multiple users (`root`, `admin`, `jdoe`, `db_user`) from a single external IP address. This indicates an active brute-force or credential stuffing attack. | 2025-12-27 13:19:05 | SOC2 CC6.1 (Access Protection)<br>SOC2 CC7.2 (Incident Monitoring)<br>NIST AC-2 (Account Management)<br>NIST AU-6 (Audit Review) | 1. **Block IP:** Immediately block IP address `185.220.101.5` at the firewall/border. <br>2. **Review Account Policies:** Ensure strong password policies and account lockout thresholds are configured. <br>3. **Implement Geoblocking:** Consider geoblocking if this IP originates from a region with no legitimate business need. <br>4. **Enhance Threat Intelligence:** Integrate threat intelligence feeds to automatically block known malicious IPs. |
| M-003 | **Repeated Failed Login Attempts from External IP 45.33.22.11.**<br>5 failed login attempts targeting multiple users (`admin`, `root`, `webapp`, `jdoe`) from a single external IP address. This indicates another active brute-force or credential stuffing attack. | 2025-12-27 19:28:53 | SOC2 CC6.1 (Access Protection)<br>SOC2 CC7.2 (Incident Monitoring)<br>NIST AC-2 (Account Management)<br>NIST AU-6 (Audit Review) | 1. **Block IP:** Immediately block IP address `45.33.22.11` at the firewall/border. <br>2. **Review Account Policies:** Ensure strong password policies and account lockout thresholds are configured. <br>3. **Implement Geoblocking:** Consider geoblocking if this IP originates from a region with no legitimate business need. <br>4. **Enhance Threat Intelligence:** Integrate threat intelligence feeds to automatically block known malicious IPs. |

### LOW Risk Findings

| Finding ID | Description of Event | Date/Time of First Occurrence | Relevant Control IDs | Remediation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| L-001 | **Single Failed Login Attempt for user 'webapp' from Internal IP 172.16.254.1.**<br>A single failed login attempt from an internal IP. This could be a user error or a minor misconfiguration. | 2025-12-27 12:21:45 | SOC2 CC6.1 (Access Protection)<br>NIST AC-2 (Account Management)<br>NIST AU-6 (Audit Review) | 1. **Monitor for Pattern:** Continue to monitor logs for a recurrence or pattern of failed logins from this internal IP or for this user. <br>2. **User Education:** Remind users about correct login procedures and password management practices. |
| L-002 | **Single Failed Login Attempt for user 'admin' from Internal IP 192.168.1.50.**<br>A single failed login attempt from an internal IP. This could be a user error or a minor misconfiguration. | 2025-12-27 22:49:33 | SOC2 CC6.1 (Access Protection)<br>NIST AC-2 (Account Management)<br>NIST AU-6 (Audit Review) | 1. **Monitor for Pattern:** Continue to monitor logs for a recurrence or pattern of failed logins from this internal IP or for this user. <br>2. **User Education:** Remind users about correct login procedures and password management practices. |
